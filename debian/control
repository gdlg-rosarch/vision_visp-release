Description: Online automated pattern-based object tracker relying on visual servoing. visp_auto_tracker wraps model-based trackers provided by ViSP visual servoing library into a ROS package. The tracked object should have a QRcode of Flash code pattern. Based on the pattern, the object is automaticaly detected. The detection allows then to initialise the model-based trackers. When lost of tracking achieves a new detection is performed that will be used to re-initialize the tracker. This computer vision algorithm computes the pose (i.e. position and orientation) of an object in an image. It is fast enough to allow object online tracking using a camera.
